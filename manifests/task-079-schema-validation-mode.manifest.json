  "goal": "Add schema-only validation mode to maid validate command",
  "description": "Add 'schema' as a third validation mode choice that performs only schema/semantic/version validation without requiring implementation or test files to exist. This enables early manifest validation during Phase 1 planning and validation of snapshot manifests by tooling/automation. Implementation changes: (1) Update ValidationMode type literal in types.py to include 'schema', (2) Update CLI choices in validate.py and main.py, (3) Add early-exit logic in validate.py run_validation() after version validation when mode is 'schema'.",

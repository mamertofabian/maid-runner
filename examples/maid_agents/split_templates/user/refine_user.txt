Refine the manifest and tests to improve quality and fix validation errors.

**Manifest:** ${manifest_path}
**Test File:** ${test_file_path}
**Goal:** ${goal}

## Current Issues

${validation_errors}

## Your Task

Improve the manifest and tests to fix these issues:

1. **For structural validation errors:**
   - Fix manifest schema issues
   - Add missing artifact fields
   - Correct file categorization

2. **For behavioral validation errors:**
   - Ensure all artifacts are USED in tests
   - Add missing test coverage
   - Verify tests import and call artifacts

3. **For test quality issues:**
   - Add edge case tests
   - Add error handling tests
   - Use keyword arguments in calls
   - Improve test organization

## Files to Edit

Use your Edit tool to modify:
- **Manifest:** ${manifest_path}
- **Tests:** ${test_file_path}

## Refinement Focus

Based on the validation feedback, focus on:
- Fixing any schema validation errors
- Ensuring all expectedArtifacts are tested
- Improving test coverage (existence, signatures, behavior)
- Adding edge cases and error handling tests
- Using keyword arguments to verify parameter names

The goal is to have both structural validation (manifest) and behavioral validation (tests) pass completely.

Please refine the manifest and tests now to address these issues.

Implement code to make the failing tests pass for this task.

**Manifest:** ${manifest_path}
**Goal:** ${goal}

## Current Test Output

```
${test_output}
```

## Expected Artifacts

You need to implement these artifacts with exact signatures:

${artifacts_summary}

## Files to Modify

Use your Write or Edit tools to modify these files:

${files_to_modify}

## Your Task

1. Review the test failures above to understand what's expected
2. Implement the code to match manifest signatures exactly
3. Use your Write tool for new files or Edit tool for existing files
4. Ensure all type hints and docstrings are included
5. Make sure all tests pass

The implementation should:
- Match all artifact signatures from the manifest
- Handle errors appropriately (don't crash on invalid input)
- Follow Python conventions (PEP 8, type hints, docstrings)
- Be the simplest code that satisfies the tests

Please implement the code now.
